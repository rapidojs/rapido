Rapido is an oppinionative toolset that makes building universal native apps for iOS, Android and Web very fast and easy. Rapido is built on top of [Expo](https://expo.io) and helps solve some common problems in Expo apps such as Navigation, Device Storage, Component Library, etc. Some of the benefits of using Rapido to build Expo apps are:

**ðŸš€ Fast Development**: Rapido makes it fast to spin up an app and start developing features right away.

**ðŸ’ª Powerful Tools**: The Rapido toolset uses projects like Expo under the hood to power your app and solve common problems.

**ðŸ”“ No Lock-In**: All Rapido tools are broken up into multiple packages and are all optional so you are never locked in.

## Creating an App

To create a new app, run the following command:

```sh
npx @rapido/init my-app
```

It will create a directory called `my-app` inside the current folder.<br>
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app.<br>
Once the installation is done, you can open your project folder:

```sh
cd my-app
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands such as:

### `npm start:<platform>` or `yarn start:<platform>`

Runs the app in development mode for the specified platform. Platform can be one of (android, ios, or web).

### `npm lint` or `yarn lint`

Runs ESLint on the app code.

### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.

### `npm run build:<platform>` or `yarn build:<platform>`

Builds the app for production for the specified platform. Platform can be one of (android, ios, or web).

### `npm run publish` or `yarn run publish`

Publishes your project to [Expo](https://expo.io) for over the air updates.

### `npm eject` or `yarn eject`

Removes the scripts tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory.
