# @rapido/dev-utils

This package includes a library of dev utilities used in [Rapido](https://github.com/verumtech/rapido) apps.

Please refer to the Rapido documentation:

- [Getting Started](https://rapidojs.org/docs/getting-started) – How to create a new app.
- [User Guide](https://rapidojs.org/) – How to develop apps bootstrapped with Rapido.

## Usage in Rapido Projects

These utilities come by default with [Rapido](https://github.com/verumtech/rapido), which includes it by default. **You don’t need to install it separately in Rapido projects.**

## Usage Outside of Rapido

If you don’t use Rapido, or if you [ejected](https://rapidojs.org/docs/available-scripts#npm-run-eject), you may keep using these utilities. Their development will be aligned with Rapido, so major versions of these utilities may come out relatively often. Feel free to fork or copy and paste them into your projects if you’d like to have more control over them, or feel free to use the old versions. Not all of them are React-specific, but we might make some of them more React-specific in the future.
